## DataRobot OSS 

Welcome to the open source organization at [DataRobot's](https://datarobot.com)! 👋

This organization contains our non-customer open-source software from DataRobot's Research and Development and Customer Facing DataScience teams. 
We use this space to give back to the community with the tools, scripts, and libraries we use to help us develop and use DataRobot ourselves.

### Disclaimer
These are the first-party OSS repositories, and as a result, there is no official support for these projects.

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
